The HTML structure is well-organized and utilizes semantic elements to represent different website sections. Here's a breakdown of key components:
  <!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type as HTML5.
  <html>: The root element of the HTML document.
  <head>: Contains meta information about the page, including title, character encoding, and links to external resources like CSS and JavaScript (currently not included).
  <body>: The main content of the website.
  header: Contains the website header, including logo, navigation links, and potentially a tagline or banner.
  aside.page__menu (menu): Represents the off-canvas navigation menu, currently hidden by default.
  main: The primary content area of the website, containing sections like "Products" and "About Us."
  footer: Contains website footer information, such as contact details, social media links, and copyright.
BEM Methodology:
  BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a CSS naming convention that helps structure CSS code for better maintainability, reusability, and readability. Here's how it works:
  Block: Represents a high-level component (e.g., header, footer, product).
  Element: A part of a block (e.g., header__logo, product__image).
  Modifier: Optional variations of an element (e.g., button--primary, product__image--sale).
Benefits of BEM on this Bakery Website:
  Maintainability: BEM classes are descriptive and self-documenting, making it easier to understand what a CSS rule applies to. This simplifies future modifications or additions.
  Reusability: BEM components can be reused across the website, reducing code duplication and promoting consistency. For example, the .button class with different modifiers could be used for various buttons.
  Specificity Control: BEM helps avoid unintended style overrides by following a clear hierarchy. Blocks have lower specificity, making them less likely to be overridden by element or modifier styles.
  While this website doesn't utilize BEM for styling currently, implementing it would improve code efficiency and maintainability as the site grows.
Adaptability: I use mixins to create different styles for different screen sizes. For instance, on a large screen, the menu might be horizontal, while on a small screen, it might be vertical.
