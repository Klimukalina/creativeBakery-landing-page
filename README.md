The provided HTML structure is well-organized and uses semantic elements to represent different sections of the website. The code includes a <head> section with meta information, a <body> section containing the main content, a header with the website logo and navigation, a main section for the primary content, and a footer with contact information and copyright.
BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a CSS naming convention that improves code maintainability, reusability, and readability. By using BEM, you can create a more structured and efficient CSS codebase. While the current code doesn't use BEM, implementing it would enhance the project's overall quality.
To make the website adaptive for different screen sizes, I use mixins. Mixins are reusable blocks of CSS code that allow me to create different styles based on screen width. For example, I can use a mixin to make the menu horizontal on large screens and vertical on small screens.
